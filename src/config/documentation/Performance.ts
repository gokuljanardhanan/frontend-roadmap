# Performance

## Overview:
Performance of application is directly impacting the business. Reducing the number of errors, fast loading of pages, finding issues in browser, network, and server level, and making application faster will increase the conversion rate and reduce user drop-offs. If we are not able to measure the performance, we are not able to improve performance.

### Why performance:
Along with improving the metrics, we should confirm if the impact is positive and users are really getting it.

### Performance Metric:
Performance metrics like web vitals and understanding application performance in various user devices.

### Measuring performance:
Measuring the performance of application for users.

- **Network optimization**
- **Asset optimization:** Assets like HTML, JS, CSS, image file optimization and fast downloading in user device.
- **React optimization:** React techniques for improving performance.
- **Build optimization:** Reducing build size will load assets faster. (gzip, brotli)
- **Rendering pattern**

### 3 Places we can analyze performance and improve:
- **Browser**
- **Network**
- **Server**

## 1. Performance importance
- **User experience:** Page loading slowly and other performance issues will lead users to use other websites, user drop-offs.
- **Productivity:** An organization internal website which is having higher loading time, the productivity of organization reduces.
- **Customer satisfaction:** Performance directly impacts user satisfaction, no users like to see loading pages longer.
- **Revenue & profitability:** Assets loading for user the revenue of organization and customer network usage also increase if proper caching mechanism is not in place. Eg: low performing streaming platform every time has to send 20GB file to customer, even customer has to download the bigger assets. Loss of revenue both sides.
- **Operational costs:** Performance issues will create issues for users and the users contacting customer care and operation team will be high, high performance applications with less errors can save lots of money on operation costs.
- **Competitive advantage:** Users seeing loading pages and less performance applications will move to competitor websites for buying products, loss of users.
- **Google ranking based on performance:** Based on website performance Google ranking is given and shown to users. SEO ranking.

### Business metrics:
- **Session time:** The amount of time user spend in application.
- **Bounce rate:** User bounce back due to low performance.

## Understanding users:
- **Device:** The application will work differently based on user device (device with better CPU, memory will perform better), Analytics dashboard can provide the user device type (mobile vs laptop or browsers).
- **Network quality:** The user network connection 2G/3G/4G/5G. The Mbps, DNS response time.
- **CPU & GPU:** When application uses high computation, JS bootup time for desktop: 0.4sec, mobile: 3.4 sec, Even to start JS it will take some time based on CPU & GPU.

## 2. Performance Metrics
### Web vitals
Key metric says application is healthy or not in terms of performance. The below are the key 3 metrics:

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** Loading -> How much time taken in order to show the maximum contents in the page, most of the time loading assets like image/video takes longer time, this causes LCP.
    - less than 2.5sec is good
    - 2.5 to 4 Needs improvement
    - More than 4.0sec POOR
- **FID (First Input Delay):** Interactivity -> When webpage is loading suppose user clicked on webpage, during this time application may be loading JS files or other assets, FID refers to the time of input or click and the output (the change in UI based on the click). The main thread was busy with some other task, so the user interactivity took some time to add in main thread execute and hence the interaction as well.
    - less than 100ms is good
    - 100ms to 300ms Needs improvement
    - More than 300ms POOR
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** Visual stability -> Once page is loaded, due to some image got loaded, banner shown or based on user interactivity layout shifted.
    - less than 0.1 is good
    - 0.1 to 0.25 Needs improvement
    - More than 0.25 POOR

### When user types website URL in browser:
- **Start**
- **FCP:** FCP is the time from start to when the user sees some content in the UI, loader or header or any first contents loaded on screen.
- **LCP:** LCP is the time from start to when the user sees the most of the contents in the UI.
- **FID:** Once user starts seeing some contents (FCP), and user interacts with the web page, to the time when user sees the result.
- **CLS:** When the user interacts some image gets added, while the scrolling shift happens in UI. This is not just initial value, but in the entire user session, while interacting (scrolling) the amount of shift occurred in UI.
- **INP (Interaction to next paint):** This is the worst time taken in order to paint/render as a result of user interaction, in FID, it measures the first delay of interaction, but INP is the worst delay of interaction in the entire user session.
    - less than 200ms is good
    - 200ms to 500ms Needs improvement
    - More than 500ms POOR

### Lighthouse
Lighthouse provides the web vitals value, LCP, FCP, Total blocking time and other metrics along with suggestions for improving the performance.

### Browser centric metric:
These are browser related metrics, how much time taken to load page, time taken by the server to respond, how many server requests made, etc.
- **TTFB (Time to first byte):** The time taken to get the first byte from server, a request is made and the time taken from server to get the first byte (network glitch, issues in server).
- **Network requests:** Parallel requests made and other network related metrics.
- **DNS resolution:** Time taken to complete the DNS lookup and resolution.
- **Connection time:** TCP/UDP handshake connection time, the SSL certificate connection time, etc.
- **DOM Content Loaded:** Once the DOM contents are loaded.
- **Page load event**

### User centric metric:
These are metrics related to user, perceived performance of user.

- **FCP**
- **LCP**
- **FID**
- **INP**
- **Total blocking time:** Time difference between FCP and TTI (Time to interactivity), freeing the main thread.
- **CLS**

Most of the time User centric metrics are taken, but browser centric metrics helps to fix issues by understanding the issue properly.

## 3. Performance tools
We can get the metrics in the local browser, but considering the different users and devices, tools are required to analyze these metrics in different devices and how it performs for other users.

### Developer mode
- **Lighthouse:** Always try in incognito mode + developer tools in separate tab, it will show diagnosis for improving performance.
- **Network Tab:** Order of requests/ simultaneous requests/priority of requests, etc. can be seen here.
- **Performance Tab:** Shows starting to end how the user sees the page with metric values. Memory snapshots also can be taken.
- **Simulated Data:** Diverse set of data from different users.
- **webpagetest.org**
- **Real user data:** The real customer metric data for analyzing performance. These tools can be used, a script will be available to add in index.html and then the tools will capture real user data.
- **CRUX:** Chrome browser keep monitoring that user data, this can be disabled as well.
- **Pagespeed.web.dev:** All web vitals in desktop and mobiles can be seen here.
- **RequestMetrics.com**
- **Microsoft clarity**
- **Google analytics**
- **Sentry**

## 4. Network optimization

### Critical rendering path
- Minimize the HTTP requests
- Async loading of js: async, defer
- Avoid redirection
- Resource hinting
- Fetch priority
- HTTP upgrade methods (http1.1 vs http2 vs http3)
- Compression: brotli vs gzip
- HTTP Caching: Cache control
- Caching using service worker

#### Critical rendering path

**Browser â€”--> Network â€”-----> Server**

The contents transferred in packets from server to browser. Whenever a packet is available, the browser starts rendering. Parsing creates DOM, CSSOM if CSS is available and JS is available and creates render tree -> style -> layout -> paint -> composite -> display. This happens when it gets another packet and when it has something to display, it will display on UI.

- **CSS**: Rendering blocking
- **JS**: Parsing blocking

**First packet: 14kb**: Try to add some contents to show in the UI in the first 14kb packet. In the index.html add some HTML, CSS, and JS to show the initial loader or some contents, and instead of keeping every JS, CSS in an external link, keep some in the initial 14kb for better initial performance.

### Minimize the HTTP requests
Instead of calling multiple simultaneous requests to the server, it is better to have one call to get everything together. Eg: 2kb 5 requests and 10kb one request, different requests need TCP, SSL handshake and it will again take time, 1 req with 10kb is better in this case. (not considering the lazy loading which will be loaded on demand)

**Challenges**
- Connection time (TCP, SSL)
- Browser limit per domain (6-10 max parallel calls can be made)

**Solution:**
- Inline CSS (Not all CSS and JS which will make index.html bigger, but only those required to render initial UI)
- Inline JS
- Base64 for images: for small images use base64
- SVG for images: instead of using an external link keeping a code for images (Initial images better keep SVG to not have external requests)

### Async loading of js: async, defer

Add script tag in the head of HTML: If we add a script tag in the head, when the browser parses the HTML, when it encounters the script tag, the parsing halts and the browser will request the script to the server, and then script parsing happens, then the script will execute. Until this is done the HTML parsing is stopped. This is a critical performance issue. LCP and all increase a lot.

- **Async**: When we add async in the script tag, the browser will parse HTML and whenever it finds the script tag, it will parallel download the script tag along with HTML parsing, and once the script is downloaded, HTML parsing is stopped, and continues with JS parsing and JS execution.
- **Defer**: The browser parses the HTML, when it finds the script tag with defer, it will download the script in parallel, and continue with HTML parsing, and once the script download is complete, it will wait and continue HTML parsing, after completion of HTML parsing, the browser executes JS. No HTML parsing blocking happens.

### Avoid redirection
Avoid redirection from HTTP to HTTPS (earlier as discussed, when the user tries to access the HTTP site, with HSTS header, the server redirects the user to HTTPS with 301/307 status code, but this impacts performance)
hstspreload.com: In this website, we can register our website to not even send a request to the server in order to redirect from HTTP to HTTPS. This will be handled in the browser itself without reaching the server.

### Resource hinting
The browser parses the HTML document, and it parallel checks resource hinting and creates a connection or loads contents parallel. 
Don't push lots of things in resource hinting: loading lots of unwanted resources in preloading or prefetching
Proper use of resource hinting

For every HTTP request, there is something which happens again and again.
- For a particular domain connection will be made once and the rest of them are leveraging it.
    - Setup connection
    - DNS lookup
    - TCP connection
    - SSL connection

- **preconnect**: Connect to a specific cross-origin server in advance. Just add a 
    \`\`\`html
    <link rel="preconnect" href="endpoint" />
    \`\`\`
    Normally when an image tag is identified in parsing, browsers connect to the server and download images, now in preconnect a connection to the server is made before and the images directly downloaded when it encounters.

- **dns-prefetch**: (does DNS lookup in advance) In some cases, it's not necessary to have DNS lookup + TCP + SSL handshake everything before, with this only DNS lookup is done in advance rest of them done at the time of encountering images/assets.

- **Preload**: Initiate early req to resource for rendering the page -> Suppose an image to be shown at the bottom of the page, and we need to preload it even before it encounters. The browser makes a connection and actually fetches the image, it's important to provide as="image" here, for script as="script" ..etc
    \`\`\`html
    <link rel="preload" href="endpoint" as="image" />
    \`\`\`

- **Prefetch**: load resources which are needed in the near future with low priority (may be in future navigation)

- **Prerender**: loads the entire page and all its dependencies in the background and not visible

### Resource hinting priority
**Fetchpriority**: This tells the browser the priority of fetching resources from the server. If multiple images are added in HTML, and the image which is shown in the first page top section can be fetched with higher priority, the rest of them shown below the page can be fetched with low priority.

\`\`\`html
<link rel="reload" as="script" href="critical-script.js" />
<link rel="reload" as="script" href="script.js" fetchpriority="low" />
\`\`\`

To preload, ref is added as preload and once it is loaded, convert it to a stylesheet for proper parsing.
\`\`\`html
<link rel="preload" as="style" href="theme.css" fetchpriority="low" onload="this.rel=stylesheet" />
\`\`\`

### Early Hints

Suppose the browser makes a request for HTML, and it is taking some time to respond, meanwhile, it returns the response, the server can return a 103 status code and provide some early hints saying these are the CSS files you are going to use. Meanwhile, the server responds with the HTML file, the server can also return 103 with the resource URL and preconnect, so that the browser meanwhile creates a connection to these resource endpoints and once HTML is available it can quickly get CSS and other resources and render faster.

### HTTP Upgrade (1.1 vs 2 vs 3)

- **HTTP1.0**: http1.0, TLS - Option, TCP, IP
- **HTTP1.1**: http1.1 semantics, http1.1 syntax, TLS - Option, TCP, IP
    - A standardization came in 1.1, the rest came into the picture
- **HTTP2**: Http1 had limitations, max number of API calls limited, streaming capabilities were not available, header was not compressed. All of them fixed in http2
    - Stream
    - Flow-control
    - Prioritization: prioritizing requests
    - Push: in a single connection along with HTML, CSS, JS can also be sent
    - This requires HTTPS to work (HTTP won't work)
- **HTTP3**: It uses UDP (no handshake and ack flow it directly sends data, even if data is lost doesn't care), It is quick and header compressed. This requires HTTPS to work (HTTP won't work)

**Feature Comparison**

| Feature                | Http 1.1 | Http 2 | Http 3 |
|------------------------|----------|--------|--------|
| Transport layer        | TCP      | TCP    | UDP with QUIC |
| Connection per req     | Yes      | No     | No     |
| Multiplexing           | No       | Yes    | Yes    |
| Header compression     | No       | HPACK  | QPACK  |
| Server push            | No       | Yes    | Yes, experimental support |
| Stream prioritization  | No       | Yes    | Yes    |

Http 1 has a limitation of simultaneous network requests, once max is reached, the rest of them are in queue and whenever any of them is completed, the next one in queue is requested. This will increase FCP, LCP, and other metrics.

- **HTTP2**: create a server with spdy, it requires HTTPS, with openssl create a certificate, install openssl in the device. Now the express server using the spdy package to create an http2 server with a certificate, the browser will now request more than 4 simultaneous. No http2 related changes in FE.
- **HTTP3**: mostly used in streaming like youtube.

### Compression 
Brottli is more useful and performant. In the response content-encoding, it will show the type of encoding in response headers. Before returning resources to the client server can compress files with these. Even at the time of build as well, use a step in webpack or other builder config at the time of build itself compress the files, and in express or in the web server add an encoding type and the compression technique. Instead of returning from .js file return from .js.br 

- **Brottli**
- **Gzip**

### Caching using service worker 

Cache policy: Repeated requests can be served from memory, no need of requesting to the server
- Cache-control, expire, etag, last-modified
- Service worker: register service worker and cache files.

## 5. Rendering Pattern
There are multiple techniques used to render web pages, initially there were multiple HTML files used for each page to render, then CSS came into the picture for styling the web pages, and JS for making it reactive. Then frameworks like React, Angular. 

For rendering web pages there are multiple ways, creating the entire dynamic HTML at server side and returning to the browser (SSR) or Sending basic HTML structure to frontend and it will add dynamic contents to DOM from frontend (CSR) or contents of HTML are added at build time and there won't be any dynamic contents, every user sees the same HTML page (SSG). A mix of SSR and CSR where some of the heavy logic or security and performance tasks are done at server and rest of them done at client side called React Server Component (RSC).

### Client Side Rendering (CSR)
In CSR, When the user is redirected to a web page, the browser gets a basic HTML from the server, and the browser downloads all the JS, CSS, image assets, and on the client side it executes calls API and updates DOM, rendering the contents in UI. In this case, LCP will be higher since all the heavy logic is on the client side and gets images and other assets on demand.

**Workflow:**
Server -> HTML -> Browser -> JS/CSS/IMG -> API -> DOM updation -> Generating DOM and CSSOM and rendering on browser -> Hydration

**Hydration**: Process of adding event listeners to DOM to make it interactive.

### Server Side Rendering (SSR)
In case of SSR When the user redirects to a web page, the browser requests HTML to the server, then the server starts creating a final HTML with all the tags/elements in the HTML body, adds some of the CSS and JS in HTML, also calls APIs and adds the new contents in HTML. Almost the final UI is ready at the server itself and returned to the browser. The browser just wants to add hydration, the rest of them are taken care of by the server of all the heavy tasks. In this case, LCP will be less, since API calls and injecting JS/CSS are done at the server so even the images and other assets already available in HTML, the browser can make requests to these assets immediately.

**Better SEO**: Since the HTML returned by the server has full contents to render web crawlers provides more score. Always remember SSR returns final HTML, so the time taken by the browser to start showing the first content also depends on the time taken by the server to return HTML. If the server has to call any downstream or it has some heavy logic which takes more time and increases the latency of the HTML file. Avoid such cases in SSR, which will decrease page performance.

It uses getServerSideProps, instead of calling an API in the component. Here in getServerSideProps method calling the API at the server and passing the response as a prop to the component. (getServerSideProps called at server and pass response to component), this is done at the time of when the user requests HTML since the page is dynamic.

**Workflow:**
Server -> HTML -> API (Some of JS/CSS) -> Creates final HTML (Render) -> Browser -> Generating DOM and CSSOM and rendering on browser -> Hydration

### Static Site Generation (SSG)
If the contents of the page are static (about us/contact us/blog/ article) it's better to use SSG, during build time the HTML is generated and cached at the web server. Every user will get the same content. The API call to generate HTML + CSS/JS/images are done during build time and final HTML generated.

If the page has dynamic content go for SSR, if the page has static content go for SSG.

It uses getStaticProps, instead of calling an API in the component. Here in getStaticProps method calling the API at the server and passing the response as a prop to the component. This is done at the time of building the application the API call and injecting CSS/JS/assets.

Here if we have time taking API call/heavy logic at the server does not increase the latency of the HTML file, since this is done at build, only build time will increase. The page will be faster since API calls assets added in build time, the server will just cache and return final HTML.

**Workflow:**
HTML + Build (API +JS + CSS) -> Static Site -> Browser -> Generating DOM and CSSOM and rendering on browser -> Hydration

## SSR, CSR, SSG Comparison Table

![Add image below]

| Feature              | CSR (Client-Side Rendering) | SSG (Static Site Generation) | SSR (Server-Side Rendering) |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Initial Page Load    | Slower, as JavaScript is required, Bit high LCP & FID | Faster, as pre-rendered HTML is served. Better LCP & FID than CSR | Faster, as pre-rendered HTML is served. Better LCP & FID than CSR |
| SEO Friendliness     | Typically requires additional effort for SEO | SEO-friendly, as HTML is generated at build time | SEO-friendly, as HTML is generated on the server |
| User Interaction     | Fast after initial load, as subsequent rendering happens on the client | Fast after initial load, as most of the content is pre-rendered | Slightly slower than CSR, but faster than initial CSR |
| Development Complexity | Higher, as the client needs to handle rendering logic | Moderate, as most rendering is done at build time | Higher than SSG, but lower than CSR |
| Hosting Requirements | Can be hosted on static file servers (e.g., CDN) | Can be hosted on static file servers (e.g., CDN) | Requires a server environment for rendering |
| Example Frameworks   | React, Angular, Vue | Next.js, Nuxt.js, Gatsby | Next.js, Nuxt.js, Next.js with serverMiddleware |
| Real-time Updates    | Efficient for real-time updates and dynamic content | Requires re-building for updates, less suitable for real-time content | Efficient for real-time updates, dynamic content is handled on the server |
| Best Use Cases       | Single-page applications | Content-focused websites | Application + Website hybrids |

### React Server Component (RSC)

RSC is a mix of SSR and CSR, where by default everything gets rendered on the server.

**Benefits:**
- **Data Fetching:** Fetch data from server
- **Security:** Token/captcha at server
- **Caching:** Caching at server
- **Bundle size:** The dependency package size not needed to send to frontend since that operation is done at server.
- **Initial page load:**
- **Streaming:** The files sent to client in chunks whenever it's available.
- **SEO**

**Drawbacks:**
- Any component rendering in server same 'useEffect', 'useState' cannot be used
